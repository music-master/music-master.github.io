  June 5, 2019 
  Final Project

  File Name:      index.html 
  Description:    This file contains the home page to our application.
    Specifically, this file contains the images of our logo, an image
    of a DJ and images of vinyl records to stay consistent with our 
    target audience of DJs. 
    In addition, the vinyl records act as buttons to search by either
    a BPM value or a song title to receive a list of song recommendations
    for DJs to use for their next mix/playlist.
    Finally, there is a reference to the Firebase JS SDK so our application
    uses the realtime database offered by Firebase.
